/**
 * DeShredder allows a user to sort fragments of a shredded document ("shreds") into strips, and
 * then sort the strips into the original document.
 * The program shows
 *   - a list of all the shreds along the top of the window, 
 *   - the working strip (which the user is constructing) just below it.
 *   - the list of completed strips below the working strip.
 * The "rotate" button moves the first shred on the list to the end of the list to let the
 *  user see the shreds that have disappeared over the edge of the window.
 * The "shuffle" button reorders the shreds in the list randomly
 * The user can use the mouse to drag shreds between the list at the top and the working strip,
 *  and move shreds around in the working strip to get them in order.
 * When the user has the working strip complete, they can move
 *  the working strip down into the list of completed strips, and reorder the completed strips
 *
